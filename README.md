**Graphs4CFD** is a library built upon [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [Pytorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (PyG) to code and train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based solvers for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications.

The new update for this version will be applying transfer learning on the existing model, to test model's performance on unseen 2D airfoil data.

## Implemented GNN models

To date, Graphs4CFD supports the following GNN models:
- MuS-GNN - Lino et al. 2022 ([https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0097679](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0097679))
- REMuS-GNN - Lino et al. 2022 ([https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0097679](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0097679))
- Mult-scale GNNs with low-resolution graphs obtained by Guillard's coarsening - Appendix C.3 in Lino et al. 2022 ([https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0097679](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0097679))

## Installation

Graphs4CFD requires Python 3.7 or higher and a version of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) compatible with your CUDA version.
We recomend installing Graphs4CFD and its dependencies in a virtual envioroment, e.g., using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
To install Graphs4CFD and its dependecies (except PyTorch), run the following commands:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mario-linov/graphs4cfd.git
cd graphs4cfd
pip install -e .
```

This also installs [PyG](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and compiles and installs [PyTorch Cluster](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_cluster), so it may take a while.
Once Graphs4CFD has been installed, it can be imported in Python as follows:

```python
import graphs4cfd as gfd
```

## Examples

There are examples of how to use Graphs4CFD for training and inference in the [examples/](https://github.com/mario-linov/graphs4cfd/tree/main/examples) folder.

:warning:To clone the jupyter notebooks in the [inference/](https://github.com/mario-linov/graphs4cfd/tree/main/examples/inference) folder you need to have [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) installed.
On Ubuntu, Git LFS can be installed painlessly by running:

```bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
```
